Description: Elbow an improved fold change test that uses cluster
        analysis and pattern recognition to set cut off limits that are
        derived directly from intrareplicate variance without assuming
        a normal distribution for as few as 2 biological replicates.
        Elbow also provides the same consistency as fold testing in
        cross platform analysis. Elbow has lower false positive and
        false negative rates than standard fold testing when both are
        evaluated using T testing and Statistical Analysis of
        Microarray using 12 replicates (six replicates each for initial
        and final conditions). Elbow provides a null value based on
        initial condition replicates and gives error bounds for results
        to allow better evaluation of significance.
